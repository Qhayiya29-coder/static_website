This project was made for Task 1 of the Bootcamp. The requirement was to build a very simple static webpage using only my own HTML and CSS, and then deploy it using GitHub Pages.
I created a basic index.html file with some content and a small style.css file for styling. Everything was written by me from scratch without using any templates.

After finishing the page, I uploaded all the files to a public GitHub repository and enabled GitHub Pages so the site could be viewed online.
I also added a screenshot of the deployed webpage, as well as a file called static_url.txt that contains the link to the live site.
